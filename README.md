## Frequently Asked Questions (end-user)

#### Can I use an image logo, instead of a text logo?

Yup! Go to *Appearance > Customize > Site Identity* and upload a custom logo image. After doing this, that logo image will completely replace the website title and tagline text.

Your website's header will automatically adjust to any logo image, within reason. But for best results, we suggest using an image that's somewhere between 25px and 45px in height.

#### Can I add a Retina-compatible 2x logo?

Yup! When configuring your logo image at *Appearance > Customize > Site Identity*, upload a second image file that's twice the size, and has the same name, but with "@2x" added.

For example, if you select an image named `my-logo.png`, make sure to also upload a second image that's twice the size and named `my-logo@2x.png`. Now when your site loads, the theme will look for that second image in your media library to use for Retina and HiDPI devices.

#### How do I display the social menu in the top bar above the header?

First, go to *Appearance > Customize > Top Bar* and make sure to check the box to enable the top bar (if it's not already). Next, check the box, "Display social menu in top bar." And then, you need to go to *Appearance > Menus*, create a menu, and apply it to the "Social Menu" location. See the next answer for more on how to set up the menu properly.

#### How do I setup the social menu?

At *Appearance > Menus*, create a new menu, add custom links to it that link to your social profiles, and apply it to the "Social Menu" location. With each URL you're linking to, if it matches one of the many supported social networks, the theme will automatically display the menu item with the corresponding icon.

For example, if you link to `https://twitter.com/jasonbobich`, the link text will automatically be convereted to the Twitter icon on the frontend of your website when the social menu displays.
