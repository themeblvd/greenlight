## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I add a Retina-compatible 2x logo?

Yup! When configuring your logo image at *Appearance > Customize > Site Identity*, upload a second image file that's twice the size, and has the same name, but with "@2x" added.

For example, if you select an image named `my-logo.png`, make sure to also upload a second image that's twice the size and named `my-logo@2x.png`. Now when your site loads, the theme will look for that second image in your media library to use for Retina and HiDPI devices.

#### How do I setup the social menu?

At *Appearance > Menus* create a menu, add custom links to it, and apply it to the "Social Menu" location. With each URL you're linking to, if it matches one of the many supported social networks, the theme will automatically display the menu item with the corresponding icon.

For example, if you link to `http://twitter.com/jasonbobich`, the link text will automatically be convereted to the Twitter icon on the frontend of your website when the social menu displays.
