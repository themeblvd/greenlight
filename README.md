## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I add a Retina-compatible 2x logo?

Yup! When configuring your logo image at *Appearance > Customize > Site Identity*, upload a second image file that's twice the size, and has the same name, but with "@2x" added.

So for example, if you select an image named `my-logo.png`, make sure to also upload a second image that's twice the size and named `my-logo@2x.png`. Now when your site loads, the theme will look for that second image in your media library to use for Retina and HiDPI devices.
